# Brennan Boss
**`Ambitious Newcomer to Cybersecurity`**

I'm a passionate cybersecurity professional with a unique blend of hands-on experience and academic credentials, including a Cybersecurity Certificate from Arizona State University and a BS 
in Global Security and Intelligence Studies from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. My projects are two-fold: to build experience with tools and improve my knowledge of cybersecurity principles.
